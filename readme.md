# Tetris in C

I made Tetris in C!

This is a project I started because I wanted to experiment writing code with at least some complexity in C. I am no expert by any means, keep that in mind when investigating the small code-base.

All tips are welcome!

## Requirements
This tool & library needs to be installed on your system:
- CMake
- SDL2 (library needs to be in path)

## Build

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
