# Tetris in C


I made Tetris in C!

This is a project I started because I wanted to experiment with writing code with at least some complexity in C. I am no expert by any means, so keep that in mind when investigating the small code-base.

All tips are welcome!

## Requirements
The project can be build using CMake, which needs to be installed before building.
The project has a dependency on SDL2 which is included in the repository.

## Build

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
